# Breast_Cancer_Detection

Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common form of breast cancer, with a 99% survival rate if detected early. The current detection method requires an expert pathologist to examine tissue slices. We automated the process by developing a 95% accurate CNN model for breast cancer classification and localization.
